### About this repo
This is the repository of Chevereto 2.X which is an old edition (yet very stable and solid) but is too old and it doesn't support mobile devices. If you are looking for recent versions of Chevereto (free to use) you should check [Chevereto Free](https://chevereto.com/free).

### 2.X versus newest releases
Newest Chevereto releases adds user accounts, galleries, responsive layout, support for multi-servers, one-click update, HTML 5 uploader and more. Chevereto 2.X comes just with a one-click uploader plus some basic features. It will work perfect if you only want to replace you current method of upload images to your server from your desktop computer.

### Updates
There won't be more updates or new features for this edition which is deprecated due the usage of a Flash uploader and the fact that is very old. Updates will be pushed only for security concerns and things like that. Chevereto 2.X is a system in its final form and we aren't developing it anymore. For newest Chevereto editions you should refer to [Chevereto Free](https://chevereto.com/free) or [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/pricing) paid edition.
